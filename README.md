Pinky
=====

Pinky is a program loader that hooks into the desktop client of The Settlers Online and replaces the images of collectibles with a pink square.
This makes them really easy to find and has the same effect as the [Pinky Web Extension](https://github.com/perceptron8/pinky.ext).
Besides that Pinky also lifts the restriction that only one instance of The Settlers Online can be run at the same time and limits it in a per user basis.

## Usage
* Download the Zip-Archive with Pinky from [here](https://github.com/Raffy23/tso-pinky/releases)
* Extract the contents to any folder 
* Execute the `install.bat`

*Hint: If you don't want to use Pinky anymore you can simply remove it by executing `uninstall.bat`*

## Building
* Clone the git repository (`git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:Raffy23/tso-pinky.git`)
* Use Visual Studio 2019 to open and build the `Pinky.sln`
